Learning a new programming language sometimes can be confusing as each language has their own 'grammar' rules.
Python is my first programming language, and it's a well-known fact that Python is easy to read.
In contrast, JavaScript has complex syntax that most of the time requires commentaries to explain the code.
As I'm learning JavaScript as my third language, I'm making this notes to understand JavaScript easier by comparing it with Python language structure.
